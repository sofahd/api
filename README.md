# SOFAH API Honeypot Service

The API Honeypot service is an integral component of the SOFAH (Speedy Open Framework for Automated Honeypot-development) project, designed to emulate API endpoints and services. By simulating realistic API behaviors and vulnerabilities, this service aims to attract, engage, and analyze interactions from potential attackers, providing valuable insights into their methods and intentions.

## Overview

The API Honeypot creates a deceptive layer within the SOFAH framework, mimicking APIs that appear vulnerable or interesting to attackers. This not only helps in understanding attack vectors but also in diverting attention from real services. Customization and configurability are at the core of its design, allowing for tailored responses based on the attacker's requests.

## Features

- **Realistic API Emulation**: Simulates a wide range of API endpoints to attract various types of attackers.
- **Dynamic Response Configuration**: Responses can be dynamically configured to adapt to different attack scenarios, enhancing interaction realism.
- **Integration with SOFAH**: Works seamlessly within the SOFAH ecosystem, benefiting from its automated deployment and configuration mechanisms, particularly with the ENNORM module.
